* Submatches

Store a submatch under a key.

Say submatch number is "1". (e.g. $1).
SP is 0.

So the sp value (0) is going to go in slot 2k where k is the submatch number which is 1.  So the slot is 2 * 1 = 2.

[0][1][2][3][4]
 x  x  0  x  x

The end will be in slot 3 (2 * 1 + 1):

[0][1][2][3][4]
 x  x  0  3  x

[0][1][2][3][4]
 x  x  0  3  
so start position is held in slot 2
so end position is held in slot 3
