  <h2>objexj</h2>

  <p>The {@code objexj} project is a library for pattern matching over
  {@link java.util.List}s of {@link java.lang.Object}s.</p>

  <p>Just like with
  regular <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/package-summary.html">regular
  expressions</a> you can build up pattern strings and match input
  sequences against them.  The difference here is that the input
  sequences aren't {@link java.lang.String}s, but {@link
  java.util.List}s of arbitrary {@link java.lang.Object}s.</p>

  <p>This toolkit has applications in diagnostics and error analysis
  (translating particular sequences of {@link java.lang.Throwable}s
  into meaningful error messages), stream-oriented pattern analysis
  (extracting {@link java.util.List}s out of a stream and determining
  what to do based on pattern matching) and other domains.</p>

  <p>Please see the <a href="../syntax.html" target="_parent">Syntax
  Guide</a> for more information.</p>
