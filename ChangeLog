	* src/main/java/com/edugility/objexj/engine/Instruction.java:
	Added getLogger() method.  Added logging in general to all
	instruction classes.

	* src/main/java/com/edugility/objexj/engine/MVELFilter.java: Made
	it so that MVEL expressions that return anything (including null)
	other than a boolean or a Boolean behave as though they returned
	true.  (Issue #6).
